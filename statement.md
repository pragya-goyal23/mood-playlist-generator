Problem Statement:
Music plays a major role in improving mood, focus, and relaxation, but choosing songs manually every time can be tiring and time-consuming. There is no simple tool that instantly gives playlists based on how the user feels.
This project solves that by generating quick, mood-based playlists that the user can view, update, and personalize easily.

Scope of the Project:
The project focuses on a command-line Python application that:
	•	stores moods and their songs
	•	allows the user to view, add, and modify moods
	•	generates a playlist based on selected mood
	•	includes a small loading animation for a better user experience
The scope is limited to text-based interaction without any GUI.

Target Users:
	•	Students who want quick playlists to match their mood
	•	Anyone who likes simple, customizable tools
	•	Users who prefer command-line apps with minimal setup

High-Level Features:
	•	View available moods
	•	Add new moods
	•	Add songs to existing moods
	•	Shuffle the playlist automatically
	•	Smooth user experience using a simple loading animation
	•	Neat, mood-based interface with ASCII designs
